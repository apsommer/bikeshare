    Hello,

        This Python 3 program analyzes US bikeshare data provided by Motivate at https://www.motivateco.com/. Three cities are considered over the first six months of 2017. The user can filter the resulting statistics by city, month, and day.

        All items on the project rubric have been incorporated.
